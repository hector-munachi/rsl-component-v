# rsl-component-v

A reusable Vue 3 component that simplifies the process of adding Region, State, and LGA selection drop-downs to forms in web applications. This helps developers by eliminating the need to build these inputs from scratch. If you're looking for a React version of this reusable Vue 3 component, check [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rsl-component).

ðŸ”— **[Demo](https://rsl-component-v.netlify.app/)**

## Installation

Install this package with npm or yarn:

```bash
# If you use npm:
npm install rsl-component-v

# Or if you use Yarn:
yarn add rsl-component-v
```
    
## Usage

Import and use the `InputRSLv` component in your Vue component.
```javascript
<template>
  <InputRSLV />
</template>

<script>
import InputRSLV from 'rsl-component-v';

export default {
  components: {
    InputRSLV,
  },
};
</script>

```

## Example


Here's an example of how you can use the `InputRSLV` component in a form:

```javascript
<template>
  <form>
    <InputSRLV v-model:selected-state="selectedState" v-model:selected-lga="selectedLga" />

    <!-- ... other form fields ... -->

    <button @click.prevent="submitForm">Submit</button>
  </form>
</template>

<script>
import { ref } from 'vue';
import InputRSLV from 'rsl-component-v';

export default {
  components: { InputSRLV },
  setup() {
    const selectedState = ref('');
    const selectedLga = ref('');

    const submitForm = () => {
      // Do something with the captured values, such as sending them to a server
      console.log(selectedState.value, selectedLga.value, InputSRLV.region.value);
    };

    return { selectedState, selectedLga, submitForm };
  }
};
</script>

```
In this example, we passed the `selectedState` and `selectedLga` variables to the `InputSRLV` component using `v-model`. These variables will be updated when the user selects a state and an LGA.

To capture the value of the region input, we accessed the region computed property of the `InputSRLV` component using `InputSRLV.region.value`.

Finally, we defined a `submitForm` function that logs the captured values to the console. You can replace this function with your own logic for handling the form submission.

## `showRegion` prop
The `showRegion` prop is a boolean that controls the visibility of the "Region" input field in the `InputRSLV` component. If set to `true`, the "Region" input field will be displayed, and if set to `false`, the "Region" input field will be hidden.

**To use the** component with the showRegion prop, you can pass it as a prop when you instantiate the component, like this:
```javascript
<template>
  <div>
    <InputRSLV :showRegion="true" />
    <InputRSLV :showRegion="false" />
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import MyComponent from '@/components/MyComponent.vue';

export default {
  components: {
    InputRSLV
  }
};
</script>

```
Here, we are rendering two instances of the `InputRSLV` component, one with `showRegion` set to `true`, and the other with `showRegion` set to `false`. This will render the component twice, once with the Region field, and once without it.

**By default value**, the `showRegion` prop is set to `true`, which means that the "Region" input field will be displayed in the `InputRSLV` component if the prop is not explicitly set to `false`.

**Take note that** if you set `showRegion` to `false`, the first input field will be hidden, and the remaining two input fields will shift up to take its place. If you set `showRegion` to `true`, the "Region" input field will be displayed, and the remaining two input fields will shift down to make space for it.
